This was one of my first readme files ever. I'm excited to learn about open source project development and this is evidence of my intent to learn about projects in GitHub. My first insight is weirdness. I find it weird that the word "Project" is used in the manner that GitHub does. One typically thinks of a project as the highest level of abstraction for an endeavour. However, here at GitHub I see the word Project being used in the way that we (in my industry) use the word, "Task." On GitHub, each repository is at the object level that I would usually consider a project. Each repository has Projects. I am used to the way of, "Each Project has repositories and tasks." But, alas, I am learning a new way of thinking and I like it. Let's go!!!
